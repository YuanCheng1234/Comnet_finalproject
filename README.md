# Comnet_finalproject
We have created the Hello packets sending to R1. Now, we are trying to use LS packets sent from host 1 to update the routing table in R1. 
We assume S is 101, R1 is 102, R2 is 103, R5 is 104 and h1 is 105 
We will concentrate on creating the routing table for R1 right now so if it works we will apply the code on other routers
